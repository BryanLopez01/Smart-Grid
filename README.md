# Smart-Grid
Built a smart grid simulation using RFID login, energy monitoring, and a simple GUI. Users authenticate with an RFID scanner, view usage data, detect overloads, and receive phone alerts via Pushover. The system logs activity and supports data export using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Python.
